# Design Patterns in Typescript

This repository showcases examples of my own use cases for implementing design patterns with TypeScript. Explore the code to see how design patterns can be effectively applied in real-world scenarios using TypeScript, as well as my experimentation to build useful npm packages from these learnings.

## Available Patterns

#### Adapter Design Pattern

| Use Case | Description                                                                                                                                                        |

| Database | This example demonstrates the use of the Adapter Design Pattern with TypeScript to solve the problem of changing databases from one to another, similar to an ORM. |
